## Dauntless V4

Developed an RPG-based text bot for Discord using Node.js, MongoDB, and Discord.js that enables users to engage in dynamic gameplay features. Players can hunt enemies, collect and craft items, distribute experience points, and manage in-game currency through auctions, stocks, and gambling systems, including duels and card games. The bot integrates a robust economy, allowing users to participate in various single-player and multiplayer activities. Leveraged libraries such as Axios, Canvacord, and Mongoose to create an interactive, self-sustaining ecosystem for a highly engaging user experience.

This is the fourth iteration of this bot.
